Explain what your contribution is doing here:

a description of the search algorithm, and how the goodness of the equation was determined?
>Using MCMC sampling to find the equation. 
>>Starting from a random equation.
>>Sample method: node replacement, root addition and root removal
>>Sample operators in operator space
>>Updating equation accordingly and comparing performance of new equation to original equation.

>> The goodness of the equation is determined by testing the predictions of the test split of the experiment data.

which search space was used and how was the search otherwise constrained?
> We travers the search space with the following funcitons:
    root_addition
    root_removal
operatriosn

> The length of the equation was constrained to be less than 40 symbols.

>The operator space can be defined to only use the certain operators and not all the operators
